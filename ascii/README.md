To install the application, copy all files from http://www.github.com/asciibox/asciirocks to the subdirectory "asciirocks" inside "node_modules":

The following directories should be in asciirocks: assets, css, fileuploader, images, music, scripts as well as the following .php files: create_default.php, export.php, subs.php, upload.php and the following .html file: index.html.

When you call the application, you will get to see a HTML5 canvas with Ascii characters on the screen, which were positioned and formatted using stylesheet commands.
